# _PhyloPic_ SQL Scripts

This folder includes scripts for creating the two databases used by _PhyloPic_:

- [`phylopic-entities`](./phylopic-entities.sql): database used by the [public API](../apps/api/README.md), optimized for speed.
- [`phylopic-source`](./phylopic-source.sql): normalized system of record used as the basis for data builds.
